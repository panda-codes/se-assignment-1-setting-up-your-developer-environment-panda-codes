Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
   
   ANSWER:
   my system doesn't meet the windows 11 requirement but found below is the step by step guide to intall windows 11

   
   USING THE MEDIA CREATION TOOL TO CREATE INSTALLATION MEDIA:
1.	After downloading, run the media creation tool. You need to be an administrator to run this tool.
2.	If you agree to the license terms, select Accept.
3.	On the What do you want to do? page, select Create installation media for another PC, and then select Next.
4.	Select the language, edition, and architecture (64-bit) for Windows 11.
5.	Select which media you want to use:
•	USB flash drive: Attach a blank USB flash drive with at least 8GB of space. Any content on the flash drive will be deleted.
•	ISO file: Save an ISO file to your PC. This can be used to create a bootable DVD. After the file is downloaded, you can go to location where the file is saved, or select Open DVD burner, and follow the instructions to burn the file to a DVD.
After the installation media is created, follow the steps below to use it.


1.	To check for updates now, select the Start button, and then go to Settings > Windows Update, and select Check for updates. You may also wish to visit your device manufacturer’s support site for any additional drivers that may be needed.


Note: Drivers for Surface devices may be found on the Download drivers and firmware for Surface page.

Before you install Windows 11, it’s a good idea to save any work and back up your PC before you start. If you used the Media Creation Tool to download an ISO file for Windows 11, remember to burn it to a DVD before following these steps:


1.	Attach the USB flash drive or insert the DVD on the PC where you want to install Windows 11.
2.	Restart your PC.
•	If your PC does not automatically boot to the USB or DVD media, you might have to open a boot menu or change the boot order in your PC's BIOS or UEFI settings. 
•	To open a boot menu or change the boot order, you'll typically need to press a key (such as F2, F12, Delete, or Esc) immediately after you turn on your PC. For instructions on accessing the boot menu or changing the boot order for your PC, check the documentation that came with your PC or go to the manufacturer's website.
•	If you do not see the USB or DVD media device listed within the boot options, you may need to reach out to the PC manufacturer for instructions for temporarily disabling Secure Boot in your BIOS settings.
•	If changing the boot menu or order doesn't work, and your PC immediately boots into the OS you want to replace, it is possible the PC had not fully shut down. To ensure the PC fully shuts down, select the power button on the sign-in screen or on the Start menu and select Shut down.
3.	On the Install Windows page, select your language, time, and keyboard preferences, and then select Next.
4.	Select Install Windows.
Important Note: If you made changes to the boot order in step 2, you may face a scenario where the initial Install Windows page will display after the installation process is complete. To resolve this, you will need to revert the changes you made to the boot order. This ensures that the internal drive you just installed Windows on will boot normally.




2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

Step 2: Install VS Code on Your Operating System
For Windows:
1.	Run the installer:
•	Double-click the downloaded .exe file to start the installation.
2.	Accept the license agreement:
•	Read and accept the license agreement by checking the box and clicking "Next".
3.	Select the installation location:
•	Choose the destination folder for VS Code or leave it as the default, then click "Next".

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
